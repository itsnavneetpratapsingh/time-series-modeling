        "\n",
        "The Z-score trading system is a statistical approach used for identifying trading opportunities based on deviations from the mean.\n",
        "In this model, the spread between Bank Nifty IV and Nifty IV is calculated. The spread represents the relative volatility difference between the two indices.\n",
        "The Z-score is then computed for the spread, indicating how many standard deviations the spread is from its mean.\n",
        "Based on predefined threshold levels, trading positions are determined:\n",
        "If the Z-score exceeds the entry threshold, a long position is initiated.\n",
        "If the Z-score falls below the negative entry threshold, a short position is initiated.\n",
        "If the absolute Z-score is below the exit threshold, the position is closed.\n",
        "The profit or loss (P/L) is calculated based on the spread multiplied by the time to expiry raised to the power of 0.7.\n",
        "Advanced Model: Linear Regression:\n",
        "\n",
        "The advanced model utilizes linear regression to predict future values of the spread.\n",
        "Lagged spread values are used as features, and the next period's spread value is the target variable.\n",
        "The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.\n",
        "After fitting the linear regression model, spread predictions are generated.\n",
        "Trading positions are determined based on the comparison between the actual spread and the predicted spread:\n",
        "If the actual spread is greater than the predicted spread, a short position is taken.\n",
        "Otherwise, a long position is taken.\n",
        "Similar to the base model, the P/L is calculated using the spread, but this time based on the predicted spread and adjusted by the time to expiry.\n",
        "Both models are evaluated based on their absolute P/L, Sharpe Ratio, and Drawdown metrics to assess their performance. The goal is to compare the effectiveness of the two approaches in generating profits while managing risk. Adjustments and improvements to these models can be made iteratively based on empirical results and further research."
